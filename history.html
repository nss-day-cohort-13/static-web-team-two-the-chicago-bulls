				<h5>Our History</h5>

				<p>The beginning of Vacay All Day&copy; dates back to 1975 when company founder, James E. Lambert, first began marketing timeshare properties. Through the years he led the company to the forefront of the timeshare industry and we became one of the largest timeshare development, sales and marketing entities in the world. In 1994, Mr. Lambert initiated the transfer of the company to employee ownership and 35 years after its inception,</p>

				<p>Vacay All Day&copy; is wholly owned by its more than 3,000 employees, 700 of which have been with the company for more than 10 years. We are enthusiastic about our company, we operate with utmost integrity and we welcome the responsibility that comes with caring for nearly half a million owners worldwide.</p>

				<h5>Our Resorts</h5>

				<p>In our early years we operated as a sales and marketing company selling on behalf of other timeshare developers. In the 1980's we began purchasing and selling our own resort products and in 1991 we started development of our first purpose built timeshare community. Through the years we learned what timeshare vacationers like and expect from their developers and were in a unique position to deliver just that kind of product. Since that time we have built more than 10,000 units at nine major dedicated timeshare resorts across the United States and have acquired an interest in more than 50 additional resort properties. We've partnered with RCI and Interval International, the two largest vacation exchange companies in the world, so that our owners may enjoy the flexibility of vacationing at timeshare resorts throughout the world.</p>

				<h5>Our Community</h5>

				<p>Vacay All Day&copy; actively supports The Broward Children's Center, a local charity specializing in helping infants, children and young adults with special health care needs. In addition, the executive team is involved with The Boys and Girls Clubs of Broward County, as well as the Alternative Education Foundation, both charitable institutions dedicated to the advancement of children with special needs.</p>

				<h5>Our Industry</h5>

				<p>Our company has been a member of the American Resort Development Association (ARDA) since its inception in the early 1980's. We take an active role in helping the Association deliver a better understanding of timeshare ownership and its positive impact on community economics, family values and vacation fun.</p>
